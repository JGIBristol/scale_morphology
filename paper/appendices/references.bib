abstract = {Body shape is an important morphological trait in aquaculture. This study investigates the use of Elliptic Fourier descriptors (EFDs) analysis and ellipse fitting estimators to assess shape variation in Senegalese sole and their genetic variance components. A total of 2271 fish were individually photographed and body contours reconstructed using 20 Elliptic Fourier harmonics. Principal component analysis identified four symmetric components that explained the 68.6% of the total variation. They were mainly related to the adjustment of the body to an ellipse (PC1s and PC3s) and caudal fin morphological features (PC2s, PC3s, PC4s). Moreover, four asymmetric components related to caudal fin (PC1a, PC2a, PC3a) and head orientation (PC4a) that explained 24.5% of the total variation were also found. In addition to EFDs, body perimeter and five ellipse fitting estimators including the maximum body height to caudal peduncle height ratio (MBH/CPH), body aspect ratio (AR), ellipticity (ELL), AR from theoretical ellipse (ARe) and solidity (SOL) were calculated. PC1s was strongly correlated with ARe, AR and ELL (≥0.75), PC2s with SOL (−0.79) and PC3s with AR and ELL (0.48–0.49). Males appeared more elliptic than females as revealed by all ellipse descriptors with a tendency to caudal fins with obtuse angles (PC3a) and heads orientated toward the abdominal cavity (PC4a). Overall, heritabilities for symmetric components were higher than for asymmetric. Heritabilities for body ellipse fitting estimators including PC1s were high or very high with the highest values for AR (0.80) and ARe (0.78) for body and whole-body, respectively. Heritability for MBH/CPH was high (0.51) with low genetic correlation with other morphological traits. Heritabilities for symmetrical and asymmetrical features of caudal fin were moderate or low and indirect selection using other highly correlated traits such as PC2s through SOL and PC3a through PC4a or PC1s would facilitate progress in the selection. Perimeter showed a moderate heritability and it was more genetically correlated with growth than shape-related traits. The data provided represent a valuable tool to assess body shape in sole and in the design of genetic breeding programs in Senegalese sole.}

abstract = {The morphologies of craters on planetary surfaces reveal clues about the geologic mechanisms by which they originate and subsequently evolve, as well as the materials and physical variables inherent to the environment in which they formed. We carried out a quantitative multivariate analysis of shape descriptors derived from the outlines of craters formed by volcanic processes on Mars, Io, and Earth and by impact cratering on the Moon using elliptic Fourier analysis (EFA) and the Zahn-Roskies (Z-R) shape function. Canonical variate analysis (CVA) was used to construct a statistical model of differences between the crater groups to classify craters produced by various volcanic and impact processes. The classification model from canonical variate analysis of EFA shape descriptors yielded a 90% rate of success for the assignment of group membership among 406 examined craters. It correctly classified 138 of 154 (90%) ionian paterae,154 of 155 (99%) lunar impact craters, 31 of 35 (89%) terrestrial basaltic shield calderas, 32 of 38 (84%) terrestrial ash-flow calderas, and 12 of 24 (50%) martian basaltic shield calderas. The classification model from canonical variate analysis of Z-R shape function descriptors classified 84% of the total population of the examined craters correctly. The analysis correctly classified 96% of ionian paterae, 100% lunar impact craters, 51% terrestrial basaltic shield calderas, and 63% martian calderas, but only 16% of the terrestrial ash-flow calderas were correctly classified. Canonical variate analysis of EFA and Z-R results shows that the shapes of ash-flow calderas and paterae on Io differ the least of all groups included in this study, and basaltic shield calderas and martian calderas analyzed together also have few differences. The Z-R model successfully classifies more ionian patera and impact craters than the EFA classification model but performs poorly at classifying the other crater groups. This result shows that the descriptors convey different shape information. The Z-R model is robust in its ability to classify end-member differences in complexity while the EFA model is robust in its ability to reliably classify among more groups. These differences and similarities in shape confirm previously understood commonalities related to the origin and evolution of various types of craters. In general, basalt shield calderas on Earth and Mars are morphologically similar and are thought to have similar origins; this study confirms that the 2-D shapes of their craters are quantitatively correlated. Similarities have been noted between terrestrial ash-flow calderas and paterae on Io, principally in their large sizes, shallow magma chambers and complex evolution; this study confirms their shapes are also similar. Impact craters and ionian paterae are most dissimilar, as are their evolutions. This study demonstrates rigorous landform shape analysis can greatly increase our understanding of the diversity in craters and the processes involved in their formation.}
