[ ] Put the segmentation editing script that I sent to Carran into the repo, with instructions

[ ] Refactor to take inputs from a config file
[ ] Write down the thing with the other solver - it might make it more stable
[ ] Write down the task to scale the size feature so it doesnt dominate the PCA
[ ] Write down a task to segment the SOST scales too
[ ] Write down a task for running the analysis but WITHOUT size information - instead, add size in as a feature after PCA
[ ] Write down plan for sensitivity study - check how sensitive the result is to the configuration
[ ] Notebook or something on the EFA process/conventions
    [ ] Plot scale outlines
    [ ] Write about removing rotation, size, dropping the (1, 0, 0) from the start
